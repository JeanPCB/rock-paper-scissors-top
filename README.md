# Rock Paper Scissors
The old "rock paper scissors", but via console game

## About
*This project is part of my web development journey with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)*

A simple console-based game developed to reinforce core JavaScript concepts.

## Skills Practiced

### JavaScript
* Use of well-defined functions
* Function nesting
* Counter implementation using global-scope variables
* Application of the switch / case control structure
* Logical and comparison operators
* Use of string methods: toUpperCase(), charAt(), toLowerCase()
* Iteration using loops (for)

### Git
* Version control and rollbacks using git reset and git revert
* Use of good commit practices: describing what changed and why
* Resolving push-related issues
* Understanding the difference between git fetch and git pull

### GitHub
* Online repository maintenance
* Merging the online README with the first local commit
* Verifying commits being sent via push

## Motivation
This project came as a result of my efforts learning through Odin Project, putting in practice my newly acquired concepts about JavaScript core: functions usage, nesting functions, how the hoisting works on functions and the calling stack in JS / event loop.
